## 📚 Project Description
In this project, I developed an application to control financial transactions, with the following functionalities:

- List of all financial transactions carried out
- Categorization of transactions according to classification of incomes and outcomes
- Categorization of transactions according to the type of transaction performed
- Creation and removal of new financial transactions
- Search for specific transaction through its name or its type

## 📌 What did I learn?</h2>

In this project, I had the opportunity to work with the json-server library to create simulated RESTful API, using a JSON file as a data source. This way, the application is already prepared to make requests to any existing API. In addition, I also used axios to perform and flexibilize asynchronous requests.</p>

I was able to work with React Primitive through the radix-ui library, which provided increased flexibility, reusability, and accessibility for the primitive components used. For the transaction search and creation functionalities, I utilized React Hook Form and hookform/resolvers, incorporating zod for validation.
